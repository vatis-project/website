# Compact Window

The Compact Window offers a streamlined display of the current ATIS letter, wind, and altimeter for connected ATIS stations. Stations you are hosting will have a cyan ATIS letter, while other stations will be shown in red.

Hold the CTRL key and hover over the window to reveal the control buttons in the top-right corner. If the right edge of the window is off-screen, the controls will automatically shift to the top-left.

* Click the **three-dots** icon to hide detailed ATIS information for a more compact view.
* Click the **pin** icon to keep the window on top.
* Click the **double arrow** icon to restore the full vATIS window.

## Acknowledge ATIS Update
When a new ATIS update is available, the ATIS letter will blink. Click the blinking letter to acknowledge the update. To acknowledge all blinking ATIS letters at once, you can also middle-click on any blinking letter.

## Filter ATIS Stations
To view only specific online ATIS stations, right-click the window and check or uncheck the stations you want to show or hide.
