# Compact Window

The Compact Window offers a streamlined display of the current ATIS letter, wind, and altimeter for connected ATIS stations. Stations you are hosting will have a cyan ATIS letter, while other stations will be shown in red.

Hovering over the window reveals the control buttons in the top right corner. If the right side of the window is off-screen, these controls will dynamically shift to the top left. Click the "pin" icon to keep the window on top or the "double-headed arrow" icon to restore the full vATIS window.

## Acknowledge ATIS Update
If a new ATIS update is available, the ATIS letter will blink. Click the blinking ATIS letter to acknowledge the update.
